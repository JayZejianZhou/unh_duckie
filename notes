How do I SSH into a running container
There is a docker exec command that can be used to connect to a container that is already running.

Use docker ps to get the name of the existing container
Use the command docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash to get a bash shell in the container
Generically, use docker exec -it <container name> <command> to execute whatever command you specify in the container.
